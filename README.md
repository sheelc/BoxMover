BoxMover
--------

Yet another window manager for Mac OS X. Built with multi-monitor support and the ability to assign keyboard shortcuts for a specific application and monitor (especially useful if the two monitors have different resolutions). Additionally, allows for more natural window sizing for specific applications instead of one size fits all.
